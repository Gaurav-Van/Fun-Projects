Using Tensorflow implementation of keras
Using concept of open cv and face detection and recognition

# Short - overview

This Projects - takes in images of 20 Simpsons characters, we only took top 10
which will be fed to model as training data and on new data , it will predict the name of the Character

# Some short important points
 - While building a Deep CV model - all the data [ here images] has to be of same size, so we have to resize
 - Image Data generator -> Synthesize (make) new images from existing images - to introduce some Randomness
