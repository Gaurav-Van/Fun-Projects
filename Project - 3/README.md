Using the Concept of Finding Angle between 2 lines using Slope
m1 =  slope of line 1
m2 =  slope of line 2
then
tan @ = |  m2-m1/(1+(m2*m1)) |

/* radian -> degree */

Points are generated with the help of EVENT HANDLING
in this case generating mouse click EVENT and getting x and y Coordinates
