Using the Concept of Finding Angle between 2 lines using Slope
<hr>
m1 =  slope of line 1<br>
m2 =  slope of line 2
<hr>
tan @ = |  m2-m1/(1+(m2*m1)) |
<hr>
[radian -> degree]
<hr>
Points are generated with the help of EVENT HANDLING
in this case generating mouse click EVENT and getting x and y Coordinates
